  <h1>Typely Content Guidelines</h1>
  <p>Typely is a creative space for sharing ideas, stories, and thoughtful posts. To keep it safe and welcoming for everyone, especially younger users, we ask that all content follows these guidelines.</p>

  <h2>1. Age Suitability</h2>
  <p>All content must be suitable for users aged <strong>10 and up</strong>. That means no violence, hate speech, explicit material, or anything that could be harmful or scary to younger readers.</p>

  <h2>2. Respectful Communication</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Be kind and constructive in your posts and comments.</li>
    <li>No bullying, harassment, or targeting individuals or groups.</li>
    <li>Respect others’ privacy — don’t share personal information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Moderation & Review</h2>
  <p>Some posts may be reviewed by moderators before they appear publicly. This helps us keep Typely safe and aligned with our community values.</p>

  <h2>4. Reporting Content</h2>
  <p>If you see a post that breaks these guidelines, you can report it using the <strong>Report</strong> button next to the post. Our team will review it and take appropriate action.</p>

  <h2>5. Creative Freedom</h2>
  <p>Typely celebrates creativity — you’re welcome to share poems, puzzles, stories, and thoughtful commentary. Just keep it respectful, safe, and age-appropriate.</p>

  <h2>6. Questions?</h2>
  <p>If you're unsure whether something is okay to post, feel free to ask us at <a href="mailto:support@joycode.co.uk">support@joycode.co.uk</a>.</p>
